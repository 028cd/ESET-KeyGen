NOTE: If your version of chrome is for example 112.0.5615.87 then you need to download a driver
      with the same version (Only the first 3 digits are taken into account, for example 112)

The driver must be unpacked and moved to the folder with main.py. Next, install the Python libraries, in cmd or powershell or other console:

pip install selenium requests
